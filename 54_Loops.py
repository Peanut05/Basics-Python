# Loops in python :-------------->>
''' Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements or set of instructions
    in a programe for instance then use loop 
    example : print number 1 to 1000 '''

''' Loops make it easy for a programer to tell the computer
    which set of instructions to repeat and how '''

''' In a while loops the condition is checked out first.
    if it's evalueates true , the body of the loop is executed , otherwise not
    
    If the loop is entered the process of loop[conditon check and execution]
    is continued until the condition becomes false '''
